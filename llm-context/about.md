# Tokens Project — Overview

## What this is
A combined language + editor system, not just a parser or just a language. The language is designed in tandem with a novel editing paradigm; neither is meant to be understood in isolation from the other.

## Core thesis
- Two editing paradigms exist today: text-based (character-centric, flexible, chaotic) and projectional (node-centric, structured, but rigid/unpleasant to use).
- This project targets a third paradigm: editing at the **token** level — coarser than characters, finer than AST nodes.
- Claim: small UX changes (editing whole tokens instead of characters) unlock large architectural gains — safer real-time refactoring, persistent token identity across edits, targeted recompilation, richer UI affordances bound directly to code primitives.
- Side effect: AI agents could issue precise, high-level edit instructions instead of regenerating full code blocks, cutting output token costs.

## Why a new parser was needed
- Token-based editors need a parse tree that UI elements can *bind to and retain* across edits — not just a tree to re-query after every keystroke.
- Mainstream parsing strategies (LL/LR, tree-sitter, recursive descent) don't preserve that kind of persistent, edit-stable structure.
- This led to a new parsing architecture (general-purpose, not tied to one language) — details deferred to a separate API/usage document.

## Sample language
- A TypeScript-like language used as a testbed, with grammar adjustments intended to make it more amenable to token-based editing.
- Language has notable advancements over TypeScript: a sound type system, a novel threading model, and will compile to native code.
- The language and the parsing engine are currently intertwined; eventual goal is to decouple them into a reusable framework + separate language definition.

This document is conceptual framing only. Architecture internals (tapes, charstrings, masks, regex compilation) and usage/API details live in a separate document.
